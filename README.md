Themes for ZSH that I use

## christianlobach.zsh-theme
I customized the [robbyrussell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes) theme to my needs.

Key features:
* shows the three last path components
* shows the current user and hosts at the right prompt
* indicates wether you are root or not
* shows the current git branch and status
